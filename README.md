# RNA-seq-analyzer
This repository contains a script (app.R) with the code used to creat a shinny app (https://thaisharder.shinyapps.io/RNAseq/). The app was designed to analyze and organize RNA-seq raw data. The app also creates a graph and an interactive table, which helps to visualize your reuslts quickly and more efficiently.
To use the app it is necessary to have your owm RNAseq data. Once you have received the raw RNA-seq data as a FASTQ-format files containing the reads sequenced from an Next Generation Sequencing platform, you will align these reads to an annotated reference genome, and quantify the expression of genes. 
The app has a tab named "Instructions" that explains how to analyze your data and how you will creat your table. 
After generating your table you can upload it on the "Start" tab and vizualize your result.
